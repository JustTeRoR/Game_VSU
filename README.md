# Game_VSU
Developed with Unreal Engine 5

## To compile project:
You need to download large files (meshes, textures, etc.) from 
* MEGA folder: [Apartments + Characters Cache](https://mega.nz/file/5QdH3QLS#kAirr3pIPPg3buE1ZO9rzjQTXyKPGTIn2_Dz9eyD7js)
* Google drive folder: [Village Location + Cache](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10p84c-DCXJnBZctBb42OMKHMrGu8YJK9/view?usp=share_link) 

After you downloaded files:
* Go to your cloned repository location
* Prepare to copy files from downloaded large files storage
* From MEGA folder, copy folder (Content/Apartments/Assets) to your cloned git repository (to Content/Apartments/Assets)
* From Google Drive folder, copy folder (Content/Village/) to your cloned git repository (to Content/Village/)
* From MEGA folder, copy folder (Content/Characters) to your cloned git repository (to Content/Characters)

So after you supplied Unreal Engine project with all it's required files, everything shoud work just fine!
